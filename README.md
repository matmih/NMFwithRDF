# NMFwithRDF
This is the repository containing codes of the NMF whose embedding can be tuned using interpretable rule-based descriptions. The final embedding is such that the factors can be easily interpreted from the predetermined set of rule-based descriptions. 
The mixture allows obtaining interpretable and accurate embeddings outperforming approaches with both sparsity constraints and interpretable NMF variants. 

The code supports the publication:
